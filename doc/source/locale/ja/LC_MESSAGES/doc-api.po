"This document serves as a reference for the python API used in stestr. It "
"should serve as a guide for both internal and external use of stestr "
"components via python. The majority of the contents here are built from "

"These modules are used for the operation of all the various subcommands in "
"stestr. As of the 1.0.0 release each of these commands should be considered "
"a stable interface that can be relied on externally."

"Each command module conforms to a basic format that is based on the `cliff`_"
" framework. The basic structure for these modules is the following three "
"functions in each class::"

"The command class will not work if all 3 of these function are not defined. "
"However, to make the commands externally consumable each module also "
"contains another public function which performs the real work for the "
"command. Each one of these functions has a defined stable Python API "
"signature with args and kwargs so that people can easily call the functions "
"from other python programs. This function is what can be expected to be used"
" outside of stestr as the stable interface. All the stable functions can be "
"imported the command module directly::"

"The modules in this list do not necessarily have any external api contract, "
"they are intended for internal use inside of stestr. If anything in these "
"provides a stable contract and is intended for usage outside of stestr it "
"will be noted in the api doc."
