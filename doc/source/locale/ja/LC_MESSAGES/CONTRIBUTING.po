"Use `github pull requests`_ to submit patches. Before you submit a pull "
"request ensure that all the automated testing will pass by running "
"``tox`` locally. This will run the test suite and also the automated "
"style rule checks just as they will in CI. If CI fails on your change it "
"will not be able to merge."
