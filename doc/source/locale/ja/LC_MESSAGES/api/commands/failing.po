" test run was not successful and test failures are shown. But, with "
"--subunit, the process exit code is non-zero only if the subunit stream "
"could not be generated successfully from any failures. The test results "
"and run status are included in the subunit stream emitted for the failed "
"tests, so the stream should be used for interpretting the failing tests. "
"If no subunit stream is emitted with --subunit and a zero exit code then "
"there were no failures in the most recent run in the repository."
